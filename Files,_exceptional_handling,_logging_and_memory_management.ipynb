        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages run code line by line using an interpreter.\n",
        "     Example: Python, JavaScript.\n",
        "  - Compiled languages convert the whole code into machine language before running, using a compiler.\n",
        "   Example: C, C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors in your code so it doesn’t crash.\n",
        " - You use try, except, and finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally block is used to write code that always runs, no matter what—whether there’s an error or not.\n",
        " -  Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        " - To clean up resources like closing files or ending connections.\n",
        "  - To make sure some important code always executes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python ?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  - Logging in Python is a way to record messages about what your program is doing.\n",
        "  - It helps you track errors, debug, and monitor your code.\n",
        "  - Instead of using print(), logging gives more control over how and where messages are shown (console, file, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor. It runs automatically when an object is about to be deleted or destroyed.\n",
        " - Significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - It’s used to clean up resources, like closing files or connections, before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - In Python, import and from ... import are both used to bring in modules, but they work a bit differently.\n",
        "\n",
        " - import:\n",
        " - Imports the whole module.\n",
        " - You need to use the module name to access its functions.\n",
        " - from ..import\n",
        " - Imports specific parts (functions, classes) from a module.\n",
        " - You don’t need the module name to use them.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Multiple except blocks: Handle different errors separately.\n",
        " - One except block with a tuple: Handle many errors in one block.\n",
        " - except without specifying the error: Catches any error, but not recommended because it hides specific errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " - The with statement in Python is used to open files safely and automatically close them when done.\n",
        " - Use with to avoid forgetting to close files and to handle errors better.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        " - Multithreading and multiprocessing are both used to do multiple tasks at the same time, but they work differently.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Multithreading:\n",
        " - Runs multiple threads in the same process.\n",
        " - Good for tasks that wait a lot.\n",
        " - Shares memory, so it’s faster but can have issues like thread conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Tracks Errors:\n",
        "  -  Saves to Files:\n",
        "  -  Different Levels:\n",
        "  -  Debugging:\n",
        "  -  Better Than print\n",
        "  - Monitor Programs:\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is how the language handles and organizes computer memory when your program runs.\n",
        "  - Python’s memory management makes sure your program runs smoothly without using too much memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - try the code,\n",
        "  - except the error,\n",
        "  - else if no error,\n",
        "  - finally always run.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Memory management is important in Python because it helps your program run smoothly and efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The try and except blocks are used to handle errors in Python without crashing the program.\n",
        "  - try = Test risky code.\n",
        "  - except = Catch and handle errors if they happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",

        "  - else = Run if no error happens.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - DEBUG < INFO < WARNING < ERROR < CRITICAL\n",
        "  - Higher levels show more serious problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - os.fork() = Low-level, Unix/Linux only, manual handling.\n",
        "  - multiprocessing = High-level, cross-platform, easier to manage.\n",
        "  - Use multiprocessing if you want simpler and portable code.\n",
        "  - Use os.fork() if you're on Unix/Linux and need more control.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Closing a file in Python is important because it helps manage resources and prevents errors.\n",
